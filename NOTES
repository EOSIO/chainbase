Chainbase
=========
- Performed test up to 690,000 accounts with 1,000,000 swaps
- Switched to 100,000 swaps at 700,000 accounts
* For some reason I am not entering swap-space..? Or will I eventually? (At this point in time)
* Note: The 690,000 accounts 1,000,000 swaps results in chainbase-data.csv is:
  2384, 4894, 3466, 3466.76, 3685.59
* Note: I may have to manually do a couple larger benchmarks.
- Switched to 10,000 swaps at 800,000 accounts
* Note: The 790,000 accounts 100,000 swaps results in chainbase-data.csv is:
  2108, 3772, 2948, 2934.68, 4063.5
- The last test I ran was 830,000 accounts with 10,000 swaps
  It was starting to become unbearably slow.
* Note: The 830,000 accounts 10,000 swaps results in chainbase-data.csv is:
  44, 128, 66, 70.5512, 4101.04
* Note: the drop-off in TPS before physical memory is exhausted.

Chainrocks
==========
- Performed test only using 100,000 swaps and performing a batch write every 10,000 swaps
  This is due to an assertion error I kept getting when performing more bath swaps than what I have memory for?
  And why is it that after I perform the batch write, that that memory isn't freed??
* Note: I used a key size of 8 bytes and value of up to 1024 bytes for chainrocks
  as opposed to the 1024 key size and 1024 value size for chainbase
- At test ./bench-tps -n340000 -w100000 I got an assertion from rocksdb that kept the test from going forward
  My assumption is that when the batch writing _mechanism_ goes out of physical memory, rocksdb throws
